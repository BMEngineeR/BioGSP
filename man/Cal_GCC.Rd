\title{Calculate Graph Cross-Correlation (GCC) - DEPRECATED}
\usage{
Cal_GCC(
  data.in = NULL,
  knee = NULL,
  signal1 = NULL,
  signal2 = NULL,
  eigenvector = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.in}{Data frame containing the signals}

\item{knee}{Knee point for frequency cutoff}

\item{signal1}{Name of first signal column}

\item{signal2}{Name of second signal column}

\item{eigenvector}{Matrix of eigenvectors}
}
\value{
Cosine similarity value
}
\description{
\strong{DEPRECATED:} This function is deprecated. Use \code{\link{sgwt_similarity}} instead 
for more comprehensive signal similarity analysis with energy normalization and advanced features.

Calculate Graph Cross-Correlation between two signals using Graph Fourier Transform.
This is a simplified approach that only considers low-frequency GFT components.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# DEPRECATED - use sgwt_similarity instead
# gcc_value <- Cal_GCC(data, knee = 10, signal1 = "sig1", signal2 = "sig2", eigenvector = U)

# NEW RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
# sgwt1 <- SGWT(data, signal = "signal1", k = 25, J = 4)
# sgwt2 <- SGWT(data, signal = "signal2", k = 25, J = 4)  
# similarity <- sgwt_similarity(sgwt1, sgwt2)
}
