## What is BioGSP?

BioGSP is an R package that brings **Graph Signal Processing** to biological data analysis. It provides tools for analyzing spatial patterns in biological data using advanced mathematical techniques from graph theory and signal processing.

## What is SGWT?

**Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform (SGWT)** is a mathematical technique that extends classical wavelet analysis to graphs and irregular spatial domains. Think of it as a "microscope" that can examine spatial patterns at different scales simultaneously:

-  **Multi-scale Analysis**: See both fine details and broad patterns in your spatial data
-  **Frequency Decomposition**: Separate smooth background patterns from sharp spatial features  
-  **Irregular Domains**: Works with any spatial layout, not just regular grids
-  **Perfect Reconstruction**: Can perfectly reconstruct your original signal from the decomposition

## What is SGCC?

**Spectral Graph Cross-Correlation (SGCC)** measures how similar two spatial patterns are across different scales using Fourier domain analysis:

-  **Fourier Domain Computation**: Works directly with spectral coefficients for mathematical accuracy
-  **DC Component Exclusion**: Ignores constant offset (Î» = 0) to focus on meaningful spatial patterns
-  **Multi-scale Similarity**: Considers both fine-scale and broad-scale similarities
-  **Energy Normalized**: Fair comparison using Parseval's theorem-consistent energy weighting
-  **Robust Metric**: Ranges from -1 to 1, where higher values indicate greater similarity

## How This Package Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Spatial Data] --> B[initSGWT]
    B --> C[runSpecGraph]
    C --> D[runSGWT]
    D --> E[runSGCC]
    E --> F[Results & Visualization]
```

**Workflow**
1. **`initSGWT()`**: Initialize SGWT object with your spatial data and parameters
2. **`runSpecGraph()`**: Build graph structure (adjacency, Laplacian, eigendecomposition) and auto-generate scales
3. **`runSGWT()`**: Perform forward and inverse SGWT transforms on all signals
4. **`runSGCC()`**: Calculate Fourier domain weighted similarity between signals (excludes DC component)
5. **Visualization**: Use updated plotting functions with Fourier domain energy analysis

## Installation

Install BioGSP directly from GitHub:

```r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install BioGSP from GitHub
devtools::install_github("BMEngineeR/BioGSP")
```

## Quick Start

### Workflow (Recommended)

```r
library(BioGSP)

# Your data should have: x, y coordinates and signal(s)
# Example with synthetic data
set.seed(123)
demo_data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(1:10, each = 10) ,
  y = rep(1:10, times = 10),
  signal1 = sin(0.5 * rep(1:10, each = 10)) + rnorm(100, 0, 0.1),
  signal2 = cos(0.3 * rep(1:10, times = 10)) + rnorm(100, 0, 0.1)
)

# Step 1: Initialize SGWT object
SG <- initSGWT(demo_data, 
               signals = c("signal1", "signal2"), 
               J = 4, 
               kernel_type = "heat")

# Step 2: Build spectral graph (scales auto-generated based on eigenvalues)
SG <- runSpecGraph(SG, k = 8, laplacian_type = "normalized", length_eigenvalue = 30)

# Visualize Fourier modes (eigenvectors) - 5 low and 5 high frequency modes
fourier_modes <- plot_FM(SG, mode_type = "both", n_modes = 5, ncol = 5)
print(fourier_modes)

# Step 3: Run SGWT analysis
SG <- runSGWT(SG)

# Step 4: Check results
print(SG)

# Analyze energy distribution (Fourier domain, excludes DC component)
energy_analysis <- sgwt_energy_analysis(SG, "signal1")
print(energy_analysis)

# Visualize decomposition
plots <- plot_sgwt_decomposition(SG, "signal1")
print(plots)
```

### Compare Two Spatial Patterns

```r
# Calculate Fourier domain similarity between signals in the same SGWT object
similarity <- runSGCC("signal1", "signal2", SG = SG)
print(paste("SGCC Score:", round(similarity$S, 4)))
print(paste("Low-frequency similarity:", round(similarity$c_low, 4)))
print(paste("High-frequency similarity:", round(similarity$c_nonlow, 4)))
print(paste("Energy weights - Low:", round(similarity$w_low, 4), "High:", round(similarity$w_NL, 4)))

# Or compare between different SGWT objects
SG2 <- initSGWT(demo_data, signals = "signal2", J = 4)
# Scales auto-generated during graph construction
SG2 <- runSpecGraph(SG2, k = 8, laplacian_type = "normalized", length_eigenvalue = 30)
SG2 <- runSGWT(SG2)

similarity_cross <- runSGCC(SG, SG2)  # Compare first signals from each object
print(paste("Cross-object SGCC Score:", round(similarity_cross$S, 4)))
```

## SGWT Object Structure

The new SGWT object contains:

- **Data**: Original data, coordinate columns, signal names
- **Graph**: Adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
- **Forward**: SGWT forward transform results (original and filtered Fourier coefficients, filters)
- **Inverse**: Inverse transform results (vertex approximations, reconstructed signal, reconstruction error)
- **Parameters**: All analysis parameters (scales, J, kernel_type, etc.) - scales auto-generated in runSpecGraph

## Use Cases

### Biological Applications
- **Spatial Transcriptomics**: Compare gene expression patterns across tissue regions
- **Single-cell Analysis**: Analyze the spatial organization of cell types
