Description: Implementation of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) methods including Spectral 
    Graph Wavelet Transform (SGWT) for analyzing spatial patterns in biological data. 
    Based on Hammond, Vandergheynst, and Gribonval (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.acha.2010.04.005>. Provides tools for multi-scale analysis of biology spatial signals, including forward and inverse transforms, energy analysis, and visualization functions tailored for biological applications. Biological application example is on Stephanie, Yao, Yuzhou (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.12.20.629650>.
