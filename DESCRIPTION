Title: Biological Graph Signal Processing for Spatial Data Analysis
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Yuzhou Chang <yuzhou.chang@osumc.edu>
Maintainer: Yuzhou Chang <yuzhou.chang@osumc.edu>
Description: Implementation of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) methods including Spectral 
    Graph Wavelet Transform (SGWT) for analyzing spatial patterns in biological data. 
    Based on Hammond, Vandergheynst, and Gribonval (2011) "Wavelets on Graphs via 
    Spectral Graph Theory". Provides tools for multi-scale analysis of spatial signals, 
    including forward and inverse transforms, energy analysis, and visualization functions 
    tailored for biological applications.
